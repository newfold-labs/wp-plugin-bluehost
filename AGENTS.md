# Agent guidance – Bluehost WordPress Plugin

This file gives AI agents a quick orientation to the repo. For full detail, see the **docs/** directory.

## What this project is

- **Bluehost WordPress Plugin** – WordPress plugin that connects a site to the Bluehost control panel (performance, security, updates). Maintained by Newfold Labs; brand context is always `bluehost`.
- **Stack:** PHP 7.4+ (plugin bootstrap, REST API, upgrades), React admin UI (React Router, Redux-style state, `@wordpress/components`, `@newfold/ui-component-library`).
- **Architecture:** Newfold Module Loader; Composer-loaded modules (e.g. `wp-module-performance`, `wp-module-coming-soon`, `wp-module-marketplace`) register via the container in `bootstrap.php`.

## Key paths

| Purpose        | Location |
|----------------|----------|
| Main plugin + bootstrap | `bluehost-wordpress-plugin.php`, `bootstrap.php` |
| Admin UI (React)       | `src/app/` (pages, components, data, util) |
| Routes                 | `src/app/data/routes.js` |
| Backend PHP            | `inc/` (Admin, RestApi, upgrades, widgets, etc.) |
| Module config          | `bootstrap.php` + Composer deps in `vendor/newfold-labs/` |
| Build output           | `build/<version>/` (e.g. `build/4.14.1/`) |

## Essential commands

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps && composer install   # deps
npm run start                                         # dev with hot reload
npm run build                                         # production build
npm run test:e2e                                      # Playwright e2e
npm run test:unit                                     # JS unit tests
composer run lint && composer run fix                 # PHP lint/fix
npm run lint:js && npm run lint:js:fix                 # JS lint/fix
npx wp-env start                                      # local WordPress (port 8882)
npm run set-version-bump                              # bump version in all 3 places
```

Version must stay in sync in: plugin header and `BLUEHOST_PLUGIN_VERSION` in `bluehost-wordpress-plugin.php`, and `package.json` version.

## Documentation

- **Full documentation** for both agents and humans is in **docs/**. Start with **docs/index.md** for a table of contents and short descriptions of each doc.
- **CLAUDE.md** in this repo is a symlink to this file (AGENTS.md).

## Keeping documentation current

**When you change code, features, or workflows, update the docs so they stay accurate.**

- Prefer updating the appropriate file(s) in **docs/** over leaving docs out of date.
- If you add or remove routes, pages, modules, or major behavior, update the relevant docs (e.g. `docs/frontend.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/getting-started.md`).
- If release or version steps change, update `docs/release.md` and any version instructions in **docs/**.
